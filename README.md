This repo focuses on visualizing the data structures and algorithms 

## Sorting Visualization 

There are various types of sorting algorithms and it is very difficult to understand their working without visualization.
Hence we decided to visualize these sorting algos in python with the help of matplotlib.animations

Pro tip :- Time complexity can also be seen through these visualizations

#### All sortings are done on randomly generated arrays of size 30.
